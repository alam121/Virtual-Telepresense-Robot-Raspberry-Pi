# Virtual Telepresense Robot

Tele-presence is the use of virtual reality technology, especially for remote control of machinery or for apparent participation in distant events. 

The robot used in this project uses a 12-V rechargeable battery to wirelessly control H-Bridge [l298n](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/L298_H_Bridge.pdf).
The H-bridge is controlled using a RF reciever and transmitter circuit to operate its wheels wirelessly

The telepresense part of the robot includes the following items:

* Raspberry Pi-3
* Pi-Cam
* Servo motor
* Mobile phone with accelerometer sensor
